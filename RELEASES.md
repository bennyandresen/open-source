# [Uri](https://github.com/lambadisland/uri) 1.3.45 (2020-05-01 / a04368b)

-  Added function for dealing with query strings as maps: `query-string->map`,
  `map->query-string`, `query-map`, `query-encode`, `assoc-query`,
  `assoc-query*`.
-  Fix query string normalization, for delimiter characters like `=` and `+`
  there is a semantic difference between the encoded and decoded form, when they
  are encoded in the input normalization should not decode them and vice versa

# [Deep-diff2](https://github.com/lambadisland/deep-diff2) 2.0.0-93 (2020-04-20 / 6ff9209)

-  Fix unsupported cljs lookbehind regex in code inherited from Puget

# [Glogi](https://github.com/lambadisland/glogi) 1.0-60 (2020-04-15 / 71bea10)

# [Edn-lines](https://github.com/lambadisland/edn-lines) 0.0-5 (2020-04-03 / b4300af)

-  First public API: `slurp`, `spit`, `reader-seq`, `append`, `with-append`

# [Glogi](https://github.com/lambadisland/glogi) 1.0-44 (2020-04-02 / 5a377e7)

-  Added colored printing of objects and arrays
-  Fixed colored printing of seqs and vectors
-  Better mapping of log levels to log methods and colors. `:trace` is now an
  alias for `:finer`, `:debug` for `:fine` (before `:trace` = `:fine` , `:debug`
  = `:config`)

# [Glogi](https://github.com/lambadisland/glogi) 1.0-47 (2020-04-02 / 35d7fff)

-  Print support for cljs.core.PersistentQueue

# [Deep-diff2](https://github.com/lambadisland/deep-diff2) 2.0.0-84 (2020-04-01 / 9c2af83)

-  Typos in deep_diff2.cljs resulting from naming changes

# [Glogi](https://github.com/lambadisland/glogi) 1.0-41 (2020-03-31 / ab9f97f)

-  Added colorization of Clojure data structures, for places where devtools is
  not available
-  Added the `config` macro, which logs to the corresponding log level

# [Glogi](https://github.com/lambadisland/glogi) 0.0-36 (2020-03-30 / e2606fb)

-  Added `spy` macro, logs the expression and its return value, returns the value
-  Added logging macros corresponding with goog.log log levels: `shout`,
  `severe`, `fine`, `finer`, `finest`
-  Use the correct console log method (log, error, warn, info) based on the log
  level

# [Kaocha-cloverage](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cloverage) 1.0-45 (2020-03-29 / 8642129)

-  Get rid of clojure.tools.reader warnings, by switching to a Cloverage version
  that does not include an AOT compiled clojure.tools.reader.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 1.0-612 (2020-03-29 / 06293c8)

-  Kaocha's own plugins can now use a simple keyword in `tests.edn`, e.g.
  `:notifier` instead of `:kaocha.plugin/notifier`, similar to what we do on the
  command line.
-  Bumped several dependencies: org.clojure/spec.alpha, org.clojure/tools.cli, and aero

# [Deep-diff2](https://github.com/lambadisland/deep-diff2) 2.0.0-72 (2020-03-27 / 2862182)

-  Added support for ClojureScript (ported to CLJC)
-  Changed namespace and artifact (jar) names to include a "2" suffix, because of breaking changes.

# [Glogi](https://github.com/lambadisland/glogi) 0.0-29 (2020-03-25 / 991866f)

-  Got rid of the `LogBuffer/CAPACITY` hack, to prevent issues with advanced
  compilation

# [Glogi](https://github.com/lambadisland/glogi) 0.0-33 (2020-03-25 / cd9df6b)

-  Added the ability to use keywords or symbols to look up a logger, or the
  special `:glogi/root` to find the root logger.
-  Fixed `set-levels` to match its docstring. Takes a map.

# [Tools.namespace](https://github.com/lambadisland/tools.namespace) 0.0-237 (2020-03-11 / 45b51b6)

-  `ctn-find/find-namespaces-in-dir` no longer swallows exceptions when the ns
  form can't be read, instead it returns a triplet of
  [::ctn-find/reader-exception io-file exception]

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-601 (2020-03-11 / 6b88d96)

-  Namespaces where the ns form can not be read by tools.readers are now reported
  as a test failure, rather than being quietly ignored.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-597 (2020-03-10 / 746943b)

-  Added support in the reporter for the `=?` macro as used in Expectations
  (thanks [@dharrigan](https://github.com/dharrigan) ðŸŽ‰)

# [Kaocha-cljs](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cljs) 0.0-71 (2020-02-24 / 773860f)

-  Depend on an actual version of Glogi, instead or "RELEASE"

# [Uri](https://github.com/lambadisland/uri) 1.2.1 (2020-02-23 / a992787)

-  Remove dependencies on ClojureScript and data.json.

# [Uri](https://github.com/lambadisland/uri) 1.2.0 (2020-02-17 / c0e1f1a)

-  `lambdaisland.uri.normalize/normalize`, for normalizing URI instances.
-  Added type hints to avoid reflection (thanks @totakke!)

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-590 (2020-02-05 / 70d314f)

-  Fix support for dynamic bindings with `set!` in watch mode. (thanks
  [@frenchy64](https://github.com/frenchy64))
-  Fixes support for `:config` hooks in the hooks plugin.

# [Kaocha-boot](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-boot) 0.0-20 (2020-01-23 / 7e209fb)

-  Inherit dependencies in Boot pod without modification (thanks [@jffry](https://github.com/jffry))

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-581 (2020-01-22 / be2bd38)

-  Breaking change! Focus/skip options are now applied in two passes, once for
  options in `tests.edn`, once for command-line/REPL options. The result is that
  command line options can only narrow the set of tests to be run. (thanks
  [@otwieracz](https://github.com/otwieracz))

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-573 (2020-01-13 / 156d084)

-  Added `#meta-merge` reader literal for `tests.edn`. (thanks
  [@RickyMoynihan](https://github.com/RickMoynihan))

# [Kaocha-cljs](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cljs) 0.0-68 (2019-12-25 / 71c2d86)

-  Wait for websocket client namespace to load before attempting to connect. This
  should help in particular with reliability when running against a browser
  environment.
-  Pick a free port for websockets automatically instead of using a hard-coded port

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-565 (2019-12-10 / 72be8ec)

-  Fix an issue with the Kaocha keyword hierarchy where two keys had an ancestor
  via two different paths, causing problems when trying to `underive`.
-  Make the version-filter plugin work with non-numeric version segments, as in
  `"1.8.0_212-20190523183340.buildslave.jdk8u"`

# [Kaocha-cucumber](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cucumber) 0.0-53 (2019-11-04 / 281b7b5)

-  Fixed reflection warnings
-  Updated Clojure and Kaocha to latest versions

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-549 (2019-10-01 / aff529c)

-  Added the `--profile` command line flag, which gets passed to Aero's `#profile
  {}` tagged literal reader. Defaults to `:ci` when `CI=true`.
-  Output a warning when `--focus TESTABLE-ID` does not match any tests.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-554 (2019-10-01 / fc5d93a)

-  Fix regression, only show the `--focus` warning when applicable

# [Kaocha-cloverage](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cloverage) 0.0-41 (2019-09-25 / 0f12673)

-  Support code using tagged literals ([#6](https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha-cloverage/pull/6))

# [Kaocha-cljs](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cljs) 0.0-59 (2019-09-12 / 9159233)

-  Added support for matcher-combinators
-  When using the nodejs repl type, automatically set the CLJS compile target to :nodejs

# [Kaocha-cljs](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cljs) 0.0-51 (2019-09-11 / 4b6a751)

-  Added compatibility with Figwheel REPL
-  Make the CLJS-side logging configurable with `:closure-defines`
-  Use the same compiler env for the load and run stages
-  isomorphic-ws is no longer needed on Node (ws still is)
-  rework the websocket connection to be more reliable

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-541 (2019-09-11 / c97a2cb)

-  The `kaocha.report.progress/progress` progress bar reporter now allows the
  appropriate exception to be reported when there is a syntax error in Clojure
  source code. Was formerly throwing NullPointerException.
-  Consolidate `kaocha.hierarchy`, so it can be used for kaocha-cljs

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-529 (2019-07-04 / 975bbc6)

-  Be smarter about loading namespaces and resolving vars for dynamic bindings
  set in `tests.edn`

# [Kaocha-cljs](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cljs) 0.0-40 (2019-07-02 / d0324dd)

-  Correctly pass custom compiler-options to the prepl
-  Instead of using the ClojureScript PREPL we now use a queue based solution
  that bypasses the need for a Reader. This should hopefully lead to better
  reliability.

# [Glogi](https://github.com/lambadisland/glogi) 0.0-25 (2019-06-25 / 0e226a8)

-  Added `set-level` for convenience
-  Fix assertion in `set-level`

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-521 (2019-06-19 / b652f99)

-  Type hints to eliminate reflection warnings.
-  Fix `--watch` when invoked without a `[:kaocha/cli-options :config-file]`,
  either because `tests.edn` doesn't exist, or the config originated elsewhere.
-  Make `kaocha.repl/config` set `[:kaocha/cli-options :config-file]` if
  applicable.
-  Handle exceptions in `--watch` higher up, to prevent certain errors from being
  silently ignored.
-  When providing dynamic var bindings in `tests.edn`, we now try to load the
  given namespaces before setting the bindings.

# [Glogi](https://github.com/lambadisland/glogi) 0.0-18 (2019-06-11 / a27f7fc)

-  `lambdaisland.glogi.console` provides an alternative to `goog.debug.Console`,
  with the main benefit that it will log full data structures, thus playing
  nicely with cljs-devtools
-  Added an `info` macro for compat with pedestal.
-  The default formatter is now `identity` instead of `pr-str`. This way we
  preserve full data structures until the last minute. Note that goog.debug.Logger
  will stringify the message, unless care is taken for it not to.

# [Glogi](https://github.com/lambadisland/glogi) 0.0-22 (2019-06-11 / 0d56b02)

-  Fix glogi.console when devtools isn't available

# [Glogi](https://github.com/lambadisland/glogi) 0.0-13 (2019-06-10 / 0668ebe)


# [Kaocha-cljs](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cljs) 0.0-32 (2019-04-23 / 3d46a25)

-  Honor `:kaocha.testable/wrap`, and thus `:kaocha.hooks/wrap-run`, which fixes
  support for output capturing. This work is funded by
  [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com/).

# [Kaocha-cljs](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cljs) 0.0-29 (2019-04-16 / 56f47ff)

-  The `kaocha.type.cljs/*debug*` var can be set to see what kaocha-cljs is doing
  (use `:binding {kaocha.type.cljs/*debug* true}` in `tests.edn`)
-  Proper support `cljs.test/use-fixtures`. It still only supports the map
  version, i.e. `(use-fixtures :once {:before ... :after ...})`, but should run
  both `:once`, and `:each` fixtures, honoring uses of `async` in the fixture
  functions. This work is funded by [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com/).
-  Improved error handling and cleanup, to prevent cases where Kaocha would fail
  to exit after an exception.

# [Deep-diff2](https://github.com/lambadisland/deep-diff2) 0.0-47 (2019-04-11 / 27cf55c)

-  Print `#uuid` and `#inst` similarly to how the Clojure printer handles them. This handles `java.util.Date`, `java.util.GregorianCalendar`, `java.sql.Timestamp`, `java.util.UUID`. (by [Nate Smith](https://github.com/nwjsmith))
-   mvxcvi/puget {:mvn/version "1.1.1"} -> {:mvn/version "1.1.2"}

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-418 (2019-04-11 / d445b44)

-  Make sure "no tests found" warning only shows up when it really needs to.
-  lambdaisland/deep-diff {:mvn/version "0.0-29"} -> {:mvn/version "0.0-47"}
-  nubank/matcher-combinators {:mvn/version "0.8.1"} -> {:mvn/version "0.9.0"}

# [Kaocha-cljs](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cljs) 0.0-24 (2019-04-09 / 248e33c)

-  Added support for `cljs.test/async`.
-  Added initial support for `cljs.test/use-fixtures`. Currently both `:each` and `:once` fixtures are treated as `:each` fixtures, so they run before/after each test var.

# [Deep-diff2](https://github.com/lambadisland/deep-diff2) 0.0-35 (2019-03-31 / 3b2ad04)

-  Added type hints to prevent reflective calls

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-413 (2019-03-30 / 9477eaf)

-  Added a check to make sure org.clojure/tools.cli is up to date.

# [Kaocha-junit-xml](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-junit-xml) 0.0-70 (2019-03-30 / 0377e39)

-  `<` and `>` are now escaped in XML attributes

# [Deep-diff2](https://github.com/lambadisland/deep-diff2) 0.0-29 (2019-03-19 / 3fb9abc)

-  Fix issue [diff hangs on nil](https://github.com/lambdaisland/deep-diff/issues/6) (see [upstream issue](https://github.com/droitfintech/clj-diff/issues/3))
-  mvxcvi/puget {:mvn/version "1.0.3"} -> {:mvn/version "1.1.1"}
-  fipp {:mvn/version "0.6.14"} -> {:mvn/version "0.6.17"}
-  org.clojure/core.rrb-vector {:mvn/version "0.0.13"} -> {:mvn/version "0.0.14"}

-  mvxcvi/arrangement {:mvn/version "1.1.1"} -> {:mvn/version "1.2.0"}

# [Kaocha-cloverage](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cloverage) 0.0-32 (2019-03-19 / 8da7e96)

-  Allow passing excluded calls to Cloverage, see also [Cloverage#242](https://github.com/cloverage/cloverage/pull/242)
-  Upgrade Cloverage to version 1.1.1

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-409 (2019-03-19 / 8f177ea)

-  Built in plugins in the `kaocha.plugin` can now be specified as simple (rather
  than namespaced) keywords.
-  The binding plugin has been removed, instead its functionality is now
  built-in, which allowed us to address several issues.
-  Load errors now end in an immediate failure of the test run, instead of a
  warning. They are reported as an error so plugins like the notifier and
  junit.xml can display them.
-  dependency upgrades, this fixes an upstream issue with clj-diff
-  lambdaisland/deep-diff {:mvn/version "0.0-25"} -> {:mvn/version "0.0-29"}
-  orchestra {:mvn/version "2018.12.06-2"} -> {:mvn/version "2019.02.06-1"}

# [Kaocha-cljs](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cljs) 0.0-21 (2019-02-28 / 1be9c73)

-  Add ClojureScript implicit options during analysis, fixes issues with CLJSJS,
  among others.

# [Kaocha-cucumber](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cucumber) 0.0-46 (2019-02-28 / a6dccb4)

-  Fixed compatiblity with latest cucumber-jvm

# [Kaocha-junit-xml](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-junit-xml) 0.0-57 (2019-02-15 / 3804cb7)

-  Addressed a warning.

# [Kaocha-junit-xml](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-junit-xml) 0.0-63 (2019-02-15 / 5243781)

-  Fix potential NullPointerException

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-389 (2019-01-29 / 152db39)

-  Added a `pre-report` hook. This allows plugins to inspect and change test
  events just before they are passed to the reporter.
-  Added a `:kaocha.plugin/notifier` plugin that pops up desktop notifications
  when a test run passes or fails.
-  Add the `wrap-run` hook to the hooks plugin.
-  Watch mode: re-run all tests by pressing "enter"
-  Watch mode: watch `tests.edn` for changes
-  Watch mode: ignore certain files with `:kaocha.watch/ignore [".*" ,,,]`
-  To disable output capturing you can now use `:capture-output? false`, instead
  of `:kaocha.plugin.capture-output/capture-output? false`. Since this is a
  built-in plugin that's enabled by default it makes sense to provide a
  shorthand for this.
-  Added a `:kaocha.plugin/bindings` plugin that allows setting dynamic var
  bindings from `tests.edn`
-  Preserve changes to the config made in a `pre-load` hook
-  Watch mode: if a namespace fails to load then report it clearly and fail the
  test run, skipping any remaining tests.
-  Ignore `--focus-meta` when none of the tests have this particular metadata.
-  Print a nicer message when a plugin can't be loaded (Daniel Compton)
-  Only print random seed when test run failsg

# [Kaocha-junit-xml](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-junit-xml) 0.0-53 (2019-01-28 / 69d2e2f)

-  Render non-leaf test types (e.g. clojure.test / ns) if they contain failures
  or errors (e.g. load errors).

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-367 (2019-01-16 / 514765b)

-  Added a "version-filter" plugin, which will skip tests if their metadata
  indicates they are not compatible with the Clojure or Java version being used.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-359 (2019-01-15 / 53d06ab)

-  Mark tests with `^:kaocha/pending` metadata to skip over them, and report them
  as "pending"
-  Added a "hooks" plugin (`:kaocha.plugin/hooks`), that allows hooking into
  various parts of Kaocha's process using simple functions. This provides a more
  lightweight alternative to end users for full fledged plugins.
-  The `pre-test` hook now runs earlier, so that `:kaocha.testable/skip` or
  `:kaocha.testable/pending` can be set from the hook and still be recognized.

# [Kaocha-boot](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-boot) 0.0-14 (2019-01-14 / 4c7053e)

-  Dynamically add test paths to classpath

# [Kaocha-boot](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-boot) 0.0-5 (2018-12-31 / 3962fb0)


# [Kaocha-cljs](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cljs) 0.0-16 (2018-12-31 / 214b14e)

-  Capture exception type and message so it can be reported

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-343 (2018-12-31 / c38d94f)

-  [internal] Extracted `kaocha.runner/run`, to be used by alternative command
  line runners like boot.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-333 (2018-12-28 / 89b4c13)

-  Added a TAP reporter (`kaocha.report/tap`)
-  Added a new `--print-env` flag to the `:kaocha.plugin.alpha/info` plugin,
  which outputs the Clojure and Java version before each run.
-  Filter out `jdk.internal.reflect` stack frames when detecting source file (Java 9+)
-  Prefer a stackframe-based file/line detection over taking the file/line of the
  test definition, this way the reported location is that of the assertion,
  rather than that of the test.
-  The `print-invocations` plugin no longer prints out the `--config-file` flag
  when it hasn't changed from its default value (`tests.edn`)

# [Kaocha-junit-xml](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-junit-xml) 0.0-50 (2018-12-28 / d44f155)

-  Fixed an issue in the code that strips out ANSI escape sequences, to prevent
  it from eating up some of the input.
-  The rendering of errors and failures has been made more in line with what
  consumers expect, with a one-line message attribute, and with full multiline
  output as a text element.
-  Each failure and error is now output as a separate XML element, rather than
  being grouped into a single element for each type.
-  Rendering of errors (exceptions) will look for a
  `:kaocha.report/error-message` and `:kaocha.report/error-type`, before falling
  back to calling `.getMessage` / `.getClass` on the Exception. This is for
  cases like ClojureScript where the error is originating and captured outside
  the JVM.

# [Kaocha-cljs](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cljs) 0.0-11 (2018-12-12 / 53fe73a)

-  Initial implementation

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-319 (2018-12-12 / 012b4ef)

-  [internal] Test types can signal that any remaining sibling tests should be
  skipped. This is used by the ClojureScript test type: if a test times out then
  we can no longer rely on the JavaScript environment being responsive. Instead
  fail the test (signal a timeout) and skip any remaining tests in the same
  suite.
-  Removed debug prn calls

# [Kaocha-cucumber](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cucumber) 0.0-36 (2018-12-10 / ddb341a)

-  Ignore dangling symlinks for features (similar to fix in 0.0-25, but that one was for glue).
-  Prevent glue files from being reloaded for every single scenario, providing a good speedup.
-  Report file/line of pending scenarios because of missing snippets
-  Honor tags on features as metadata
-  Auto-require transformer namespace of custom types
-  Don't emit a `:pass` event after every scenario, it inflates the assertion count
-  Make sure the test result contains result counts, for things like junit-xml
-  In case of failure the output now contains the file name, line, scenario, and
  step that was currently executing.
-  No longer add the scenario as a `*testing-contexts*`, to prevent the docs
  formatter from printing it twice.
-  Give tests nicer ids, based on the filename and scenario description

# [Kaocha-cloverage](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-cloverage) 0.0-22 (2018-12-10 / ee13a86)

-  Don't rely on Cloverage to find namespaces, this fixes compatibility with Cucumber.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-313 (2018-12-10 / b45ccd1)

-  A new work-in-progress information plugin, `:kaocha.plugin.alpha/info`,
  currently only prints the list of all test ids.
-  In watch mode: Scan test-dirs/source-dirs, rather than letting tools.namespace
  derive the list of paths from the classpath
-  When specifying test suites defaults are always provided, so it's no longer
  necessary to provide `:src-paths`, `:test-paths`, etc. if they don't deviate
  from the defaults. This also means all test suites get the default
  `:kaocha.filter/skip-meta [:kaocha/skip]`.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-305 (2018-12-07 / 8b51576)

-  Consider `(is (= ))` assertions with only a single argument as failures, as
  these are most likely typos, they always evaluate to true.
-  Honor the `capture-output?` flag when provided in `tests.edn`
-  Print captured output when a test fails because it doesn't contain assertions
-  Make file/line in failures more accurate
-  Kaocha now also considers the global hierarchy when determining event types.
  This makes it possible for third-party clojure.test reporters to be
  Kaocha-aware without having to depend on Kaocha.
-  [lambdaisland/kaocha-cloverage](https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha-cloverage)
  is now its own project, make sure to include it in your deps/project files.

-  Strip escape characters in text node, they are not valid XML
-  Strip ANSI color codes
-  Number of skipped tests and number of assertions are no longer reported. While
  some sources seem to suggest they are part of the JUnit XML format, they are
  not part of the schema, and so hinder validation.

-  Function specs are now checked with orchestra + expound
-  Plugins in the `kaocha.plugin` namespace can now be specified on the command line with their short name
-  `kaocha.assertions` namespace with custom `clojure.test` assertions. Currently
  for internal use but might evolve into its own library.

-  Added support for "pending" tests (skipped but still reported). Currently only used by Cucumber.
-  Speeded up startup by avoiding loading kaocha.watch, core.async, fipp, puget [#14](https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha/issues/14)
-  This release contains several internal changes to support disparate test suite types.
-  The test summary now reads "x tests, y assertions, z failures", rather than "test vars", to be more test type agnostic.

# [Kaocha-junit-xml](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-junit-xml) 0.0-18 (2018-11-05 / 83a953b)

-  error elements now contain the full stack trace as a child element, and only
  the short message as a message attribute

# [Deep-diff2](https://github.com/lambadisland/deep-diff2) 0.0-15 (2018-10-31 / 63d30b5)

-  Fix support for Clojure records. Currently they are considered in the same
  equality partition as maps. (by [@ikitommi](https://github.com/ikitommi), [#1](https://github.com/lambdaisland/deep-diff/pull/1))
-  Pin explicitly to the latest version of Fipp and rrb-vector, to prevent issues
  on Java 11, see [CRRBV-18](https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CRRBV-18)

-  Fix Java 11 compatiblity
-  deep-diff functionality has been extracted into [its own library](https://github.com/lambdaisland/deep-diff)

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-243 (2018-10-31 / 55bb5c1)

-  Fix matcher-combinator support

# [Kaocha-junit-xml](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-junit-xml) 0.0-7 (2018-10-31 / 163d219)


# [Deep-diff2](https://github.com/lambadisland/deep-diff2) 0.0-4 (2018-10-30 / 3d82596)

-  Extracted from Kaocha, and added a top-level namespace.

# [Deep-diff2](https://github.com/lambadisland/deep-diff2) 0.0-8 (2018-10-30 / 6bd7918)

-  `lambdaisland.deep-diff.printer/print-*` are now public, as they can be used
  in custom print handlers.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-217 (2018-10-22 / 642cff8)

-  Looking up of print-handler fails for nil

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-206 (2018-10-21 / 4654f45)

-  `kaocha.plugin.alpha/xfail`, mark failing tests with `^:kaocha/xfail` to make them pass, and vice versa. ([#2](https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha/issues/2))
-  `(is (= ,,,))` assertions are now deep diffed and pretty printed.
-  Plugins now take a "docstring" (added under the `:description` key). (For future use.)
-  `--fail-fast` mode is incompatible with the check which fails tests when they don't contain any assertions. ([#10](https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha/issues/10))
-  `kaocha.repl` does not correctly merge in extra config keys
-  Reported line number in case of failures points to the failed assertion, not to the failed var.
-  Passing extra config to `kaocha.repl/run` will still by default run the current `*ns*`, rather than all tests.
-  Honor `*print-length*` when set. (defaults to 100)
-  Make sure `kaocha.testable/*current-testable*` is bound when plugin's `wrap-run` result executes.
-  Config merging (defaults + tests.edn + repl values) now uses `meta-merge` for flexible append/prepend/replace.
-  Print the testable-id in failure messages rather than just the var name, so it can be passed straight on to `--focus`

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-211 (2018-10-21 / fd7e623)

-  Fix regression in `kaocha.report.progress`

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-185 (2018-09-28 / 15081ed)

-  BREAKING: `kaocha.repl/run-tests` and `kaocha.repl/run-all-tests` have been
  renamed to `run` and `run-all`, so a `(use 'kaocha.repl)` doesn't clash with
  `clojure.test`.
-  Skip reloading namespaces during load if they are already defined. In watch
  mode they still get reloaded through tools.namespace when necessary. This
  change is done to make REPL usage more intuitive. When running
  `kaocha.repl/run-tests` it will refrain from doing a `(require ... :reload)`,
  instead accepting whatever state your REPL process is in.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-189 (2018-09-28 / 087b78b)

-  Fixed `kaocha.repl/run-all`

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-181 (2018-09-27 / 472f63f)

-  Documentation updates

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-176 (2018-09-23 / 7fd6c80)

-  Make Kaocha's reporters more easily extendable through keyword hierarchies
-  Load errors in `--watch` mode no longer cause the process to exit. Instead you
  get a warning and the loading is retried on next change.
-  Made `kaocha.repl` a lot more useful, making it easy to do a full or partial
  test run from a REPL or buffer.

# [Tools.namespace](https://github.com/lambadisland/tools.namespace) 0.0-228 (2018-09-22 / 88d4488)

-  Forked from `clojure.tools.namespace` as `lambdaisland.tools.namespace`
-  Track load errors instead of bailing out

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-162 (2018-09-20 / dc503f4)

-  Reporters in the `kaocha.report` namespace now can be specified on the command
  line with just their short name, e.g. `--reporter dots`
-  Improved matcher-combinators support, now failure summary is only shown at the
  end (for dots or docs reporter), and output is correctly captured and
  displayed.
-  Compatibility with newer matcher-combinators.

# [Kaocha-midje](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha-midje) 0.0-5 (2018-09-19 / 2cb6b39)

-  Initial release

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-147 (2018-09-19 / 351429d)

-  Use tools.namespace.track for tracking/reloading namespaces in watch mode.
  This should make this a lot more reliable.
-  Change the `add-classpath` classloader hack so it doesn't mess up the thread
  binding stack.
-  Make dots reporter compatible with newer versions of matcher-combinators.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-153 (2018-09-19 / 25a68bd)

-  BREAKING: Instead of `#kaocha` use `#kaocha/v1` as a reader literal that
  normalizes configuration. The old version is still supported for now but
  generates a warning.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-138 (2018-09-17 / 9bc74e4)

-  Due a limitation of Aero `:ns-patterns` must be strings, and not regex
  literals. Clarified this in the docs.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-134 (2018-09-16 / d0da4e2)

-  filter keys (skip/skip-meta/focus/focus-meta) can now be used without namespace when using the `#kaocha` reader literal for configuration. Before: `:kaocha.filter/focus`, after: `:focus`.
-  Added a `:kaocha.hooks/pre-load` hook to complement `:kaocha.hooks/post-load`.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-122 (2018-09-12 / 735aa75)

-  BREAKING: `:kaocha.type/suite` is now called `:kaocha.type/clojure.test`

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-118 (2018-09-09 / cc55d42)

-  `--version` command line flag (only works when running from a JAR)
-  `--help` as alternative to `--test-help`, for environments where `--help` isn't shadowed
-  Make code base analysable by cljdoc.xyz
-  Make sure clojars.org links to correct

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 0.0-97 (2018-09-08 / 734df37)

-  `kaocha.repl/run-tests` / `kaocha.repl/run-all-tests` (since renamed to `run` and `run-all`)
-  Dynamically adding test directories to the classpath should be more robust now.
-  `:kaocha.suite/ns-patterns`, `:kaocha.suite/source-paths` and
-  `:kaocha.suite/test-paths` have been renamed to just use the `:kaocha`
namespace.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) b0a70dc267a (2018-07-29)

-  Capture output, this is enabled by default. Only output of failing tests is
  printed. This also introduced a new plugin hook, `wrap-run`, which allows you
  to decorate `run-testables` for doing things like adding bindings.
-  Reporters now always get the current testable in their clojure.test reporting
  event.
-  Added a progress bar reporter
-  Documentation reporter: show in the documentation output which tests fail.
-  The randomize plugin could cause an exception because the
  sort-by-random-number-generator wasn't stable (it violated the contract of a
  comparator). Instead assign each testable a sort key first, then sort by
  those. This does mean seeds from before this change will no longer produce the
  same result.
-  When specifying an invalid reporter var, error before trying to load tests.
-  Correctly count matcher-combinator mismatch failures when exiting early (Ctrl-C).

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 7b79fad92d (2018-06-16)

-  The profiling plugin can now be configured on the command line and from
  tests.edn, with `--[no-]profiling`, `--profiling-count`,
  `:kaocha.plugin.profiling/profiling?`, `:kaocha.plugin.profiling/count`
-  Don't count filtered tests in profiling results.
-  `--focus` and `--focus-meta` override config-level `:focus`/`:focus-meta`,
  rather than append. This is more intuitive, when focusing from the command
  line you don't want extra tests to show up.
-  Don't run the `post-summary` hook when using the API, this prevents noise from
  plugins in the `--print-test-plan` / `--print-result` output.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 3319ed6f81 (2018-06-13)

-  Added the `kaocha.plugin/defplugin` macro, making plugins look more like a
  deftype.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 9a920204bc (2018-06-13)

-  Make the test-plan available in `pre-test` and `post-test` plugin hooks, so
  that they have access to top level configuration items.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 8eeff5b340 (2018-06-13)

-  Testable now has an optional `:kaocha.var/wrap` key, which can contain a seq
  of functions that will be used to "wrap" the actual test function, useful e.g.
  for providing bindings. clojure.test style :each fixtures are also handled
  through this key, so plugins can choose to add wrapping functions at the start
  or the end of this seq to wrap "inside" or "around" the fixtures.

# [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambadisland/kaocha) 9a6fa32592 (2018-06-02)

-  The configuration format has changed, you should now start with the `#kaocha
  {}` tagged reader literal in `tests.edn` to provide defaults. If you want more
  control then overwrite `tests.edn` with the output of `--print-config` and
  tweak.

# [Uri](https://github.com/lambadisland/uri) 1.1.0 (2017-04-25)

-  Predicate functions `absolute?` and `relative?`

# [Uri](https://github.com/lambadisland/uri) 1.0.0 (2017-02-23)

-  Initial release, public vars: `uri`, `join`, `coerce`, `parse`, `edn-readers`
